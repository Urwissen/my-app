# My first Porfolio Page

I used Create-React-App to start. All things inside are build from scratch(you can see the ducktapes). After the fixing and refactoring process, it will be written in TS.

The main features are my three-state-slider with an light ☀️, dark 🌚 and unicorn 🦄 mode. Also i try to create my components reusable to handle diffrent types of inputs. The achivement components under my milestones section, can use an image, treehouse-profile or an url via props to use one component for 3 cases.

I did not follow mobile first on the beginning, because i try lots of new things and want to follow my creativity. This will cost me lots of fixing now 👨‍🎨

🚧 Info: Still under construction, not full usable or refactored! 🚧
